# Dark-Mode-Screen
The Firefox addon that applies a customizable dark screen over websites rather than making it high-contrast

Features:
 - Toolbar icon: Left click to toggle the screen. Middle click to open the popup. The icon is white when disabled and black when enabled.
 - Popup: Adjust the color and strength and exclude websites that already have a built-in dark mode option like Discord
